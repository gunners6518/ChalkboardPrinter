// Welcome to the Chalkboard Printer!
const input = require('sync-input');

// These variables are already declared for you.
// Looks like we made a mistake and used 'var' instead of 'let'!
// Remember it's bad practice to use 'var', so let's change all of them to 'let'.

// Assign the correct values to the variables.

// Log the message to the console 5 times.
// etc...

// We have also imported the 'sync-input' package for you.
// You will use this in later stages.
// This package allows you to get user input.
// Like so:
let name = input("Enter name: ");
let surname = input("Enter surname: ");
let message = input("Enter message:ã€€")
let repeats = Number(input("Enter number of repeats: "))

let n = 0;
while (n < repeats){
    console.log(`This is ${name} ${surname} and ${message}`);
    n += 1
}
